# Welcome!

"tepid's origins" is a datapack that will (eventually/hopefully) offer 27 unique and customizable Origins. Some of its features are:

- Different Origin archetypes
- Multiplayer-oriented gameplay
- Skill trees
- Items
- Item sets
- A progression system that is consistent across all Origins

This repository will contain everything in the pack, except for its dependencies. This will likely be updated more frequently than the Modrinth page, so if you want relatively regular updates, this is the place to be.

Thank you so much for checking this page out!!
*Get in touch with me @ **tepschmep** on **Discord** if you have any questions/feedback/bugs to report/etc.*

# How to update:

> IMPORTANT: It is not recommended to do these steps unless you already have a Minecraft instance containing all this pack's dependencies. Please [download any version of the pack in Modrinth first](https://modrinth.com/user/tepid) before doing this.

1. Download this repository and unzip it.
2. Open your Minecraft instance's folder.
3. Drop the `kubejs` folder from the repository folder into the instance folder. Replace all files it asks you to.
4. If you encounter any issues, delete the `kubejs` folder altogether and repeat step 3.

And you're done!
